Migrate from WebGL to WebGPU, incrementally

</div>

## Intro

> Pronounced like "deagle"

This project aims to reimplement the WebGL API on top of WebGPU, which will allow established WebGL-based projects to gradually migrate to the WebGPU over time (or in other words, to "de-GL their codebase")

[The API coverage can be seen here](#api-coverage).

## Tasks
- [ ] Buffer data
- [ ] Vertex attrib pointers
